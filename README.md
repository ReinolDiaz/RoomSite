# Room Site ðŸ’» 
- My initial attempts at creating a website leveraging three.js to create a feel of depth in browser
- My initial inspiration for this project was found whilst browsing youtube at the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxTb9ys834w&list=LL&index=5&t=7991s

## Initial Thoughts ðŸ’­ 
- The feeling of depth is an extremely useful in browser tool.
- It captures a user much more than a simple "2D" site.
- I will attempt to make a personal brand site, leveraging this.
